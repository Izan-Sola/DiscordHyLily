Discord bot to talk with Lily!


# TODO:

  - Add the new tool calls
  - Avoid error replies or "None" replies at all costs, if querying fails, query the other database, and if it also fails answer normally, for edge cases.
  - If no info is found when querying the persistent knowledge database, consider if adding the info she was asked about, and then reply normally
