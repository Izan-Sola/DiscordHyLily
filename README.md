# DiscordHyLily
Discord bot to talk with Lily!


# TODO:

  - Add the new tool calls
  - Avoid error replies or "None" replies at all costs, if querying fails, query the other database, and if it also fails answer normally, for edge cases.
  - Add chat history to system prompt, tell her in context which user is talking to her, who is the user talking about, etc...
